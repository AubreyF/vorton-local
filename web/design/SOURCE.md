# Design source

The owner authorized reuse of the reviewed visual vocabulary for portable Vorton and The Last Resort under the repository's MIT license. These individually selected design files contain interface tokens and components, not personal records or private installation logic. Their source hashes are recorded below.

- `web/design/themes.css`: source `dashboard/web/app/themes.css`, SHA-256 `ee5368013004c1e84011eaa8e06289fb8a521a18bb9c82f5430e0ae9d0aed978`.
- `web/design/theme-registry.ts`: source `dashboard/web/app/design-system/theme-registry.ts`, SHA-256 `0b41ea5dbdac3fffc8086467258d6b14ce48d0fec3d5fb7d80a110669b3854b8`.
- `web/design/icons.tsx`: source `dashboard/web/app/design-system/icons.tsx`, SHA-256 `f96b4f7438083f8ad343deb754d824829e2fb7b0ef8ae389f3f08ea220e52a59`.

Preserve the six theme identities, semantic tokens, typography, keyboard controls, and reduced-motion behavior. Adaptations live in the local application stylesheet rather than silently changing these reference tokens.

The Last Resort additions, September 18, 2026:

- The reviewed application header, installation switcher, theme controls, interface zoom, background atmosphere, menu selection spacing, and shell stylesheet now live here as shared primitives. Native design-system files re-export them; they no longer maintain a second implementation. `workspace-navigation.tsx` extracts the existing native workspace navigation unchanged in behavior. Theme registry and theme CSS are shared by both entry points.
- `fonts.css` and the selected `fonts/*.woff2` assets reuse the six families already shipped by the native application. Files are unmodified; family-specific SIL Open Font License notices are retained alongside them. The font software remains under those licenses, independent of the application's MIT license. No font request goes to a third-party service at runtime.
- `web/design/section-navigator.tsx`: selected source `dashboard/web/app/design-system/section-navigator.tsx`, SHA-256 `468cb79babc2deb2fd2f65a5348d0ba974bbc124f225283c5e0611bf8c71ddab`. Contains generic scrolling and section links, with no private records or installation adapters.
- `web/main.tsx` composes the shared header and navigation directly. It does not implement separate menu controls or an organization-specific appearance preference. No personal application directory was copied.
- `web/installed-version.tsx` is an original shared control placed after all other menu contents. It reads the running server's version and reports unavailable telemetry honestly.
- `demo/last-resort` contains original fictional writing created for the owner's requested flagship. Council portraits use the existing deterministic inline SVG component. No external images or private records are included.

Council presentation additions, September 18, 2026:

- `web/council-views.tsx` and `web/council-views.css` provide the owner-selected Roundtable using reviewed AubOS color, typography, control, and surface tokens. The earlier Salon and Dispatch implementations were removed. Roundtable reuses existing council session and recommendation records, the report renderer, and organization routes.
- `web/council-avatar.tsx` contains original inline SVG cartoon portraits drawn for the nine built-in council identities, plus deterministic portraits for custom identities. Portrait colors are illustration pigments, independent of interface status colors. No third-party artwork, remote images, fonts, image service, or API key is required.
- `web/council-timeline.tsx` provides the continuous calendar with a bounded date window, and `web/council-calendar.tsx` provides the floating date picker. `web/council-briefing.tsx` loads the latest profile-scoped briefing for the native Bridge; the shared Bridge uses its existing state. The owner-selected Orrery shares the portraits' oval geometry and uses bounded SVG orbital curves. These presentation controls do not schedule sessions, publish council output, or accept recommendations.
- `web/council-decisions.tsx` reuses the previous recommendation page's evidence, proposed record, prompt, and action controls. Its profile-wide queue is outside the selected session component. `web/council-decisions.css` uses the same reviewed AubOS tokens.
